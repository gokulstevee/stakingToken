# Staking Token


### 1. I have created a staking token contract in mumbai test-net and UI using nextjs and moralis.

### 2. Here one can stake their ERC20-token and claim their reward from smart contract.

### 3. UI render the realtime data of generated reward from staking smart contract in the earned section.

### 4. Finally one can withdraw their staked ERC20-token and the withdrawal token is added to their wallet.
