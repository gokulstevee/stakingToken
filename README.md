### 1. I have created a staking token contract in mumbai test-net and UI using nextjs and moralis.

### 2. Here one can stake their token and claim their reward from smart contract.

### 3. UI render the realtime data of generated reward in the earned section.

### 4. Finally one can withdraw their staked token and the withdrawl token is added to their wallet.
